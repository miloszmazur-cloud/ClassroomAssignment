# ClassroomAssignment
I have created a program with UI for my teacher at highschool which assigns classrooms to classes after inputing an earlier prepared schedule

The whole project was created both because of the obligatory task and my willingness to delve into the task more, as the required complexity of the project was much smaller.
The whole project was part of my International Baccalaureate diploma, and my client was my vice coordinator at my high school.
The program's aim is to be able to upload earlier prepared schedule in appropriate template, which is then analysed by the program, and then classrooms are assigned to classes.
My assigning algorithm at the beggining uses Greedy strategy, however, it then tries to adjust the assignment to the teachers' preferences.
To perform this task, as a language I have chosen Python, due to its good capability of connecting libraries and the benefit of high-level programing language, so I could focus on the creation of the program. I have also used QT library for the UI, Pandas library for gathering data from Excel files and applied OOP for better readability.
For further details, please visit my full documentation in the docs folder.
Just for reference, GAI was not used for this project as it would be a breach of IB regulations, and the proof for not using GAI is the fact that I did not get plagiarism.
Enjoy
